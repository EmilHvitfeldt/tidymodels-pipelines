## Loading packages

We are using the tidymodels package to do the modeling, [embed](https://embed.tidymodels.org/) for target encoding, [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) for versioning,  [vetiver](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) for version and deployment, and [paws.storage](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/paws.storage/index.html) for S3 connections.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
# install.packages("pak")
# pak::pak("tidymodels", "embed", "vetiver", "pins", "paws.storage")
library(tidymodels)
library(embed)
library(vetiver)
library(pins)
library(paws.storage)

## Loading data from Amazon S3 with pins

We will fetch data from and version the final model on [Posit Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) using the [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) package.

{{< include ../../_include-envvar-s3.qmd >}}

## Loading Data

We are using the smaller `laxflights2022` data set described on the [data preparation](../../data-prep.qmd) page. The data set has been uploaded to pins, as described on the [data pins](../../data-pins.qmd#amazon-s3) page. This is meant to simulate this workflow where we stay inside Connect as much as possible.

```{r}
#| label: loading-data
#| message: false
board <- board_s3(
  "tidymodels-pipeline-example",
  region = "us-west-1"
)

flights <- board |> 
  pin_read("laxflights2022_lite")

glimpse(flights)
```

## Creating vetiver model

```{r}
v <- xgb_last %>%
  extract_workflow() %>%
  vetiver_model("flights_xgb")
v
```

## Version model with pins on Amazon S3

We will version this model on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) using the [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) package.

with the `board` we specified to read in the data, we can use it to write our model to it. But you are not required to keep them at the same pin.

```{r}
#| message: false
vetiver_pin_write(board, v)
```

## Create Docker artifacts

To build a Docker image that can serve your model, you need three artifacts:

- the Dockerfile itself,
- a `renv.lock` to capture your model dependencies, and
- an `plumber.R` file containing the information to serve a vetiver REST API.

You can create all the needed files with one function.

```{r}
#| message: false
vetiver_prepare_docker(
  board, 
  "flights_xgb", 
  docker_args = list(port = 8080)
)
```

::: {.callout-note}
Keep an eye on the value of `port`, we want to make sure we use the same throughout the whole pipeline.
:::

For ease of use, we make sure only to have CRAN versions of packages.

## Build and run your Dockerfile

Now that we have everything we need to build a Docker image. We have one more thing to do. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) if you haven't already, then launch it so we can interact with it from the [command line](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) (not from R). Use the following [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command. Notice that we can give it a "name" using the `--tag` flag. The `.` here denotes the path to the build context. Which in this example is the folder we are in.

```bash
docker build --tag flights .
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are on an ARM architecture locally and deploying an R model, use `--platform linux/amd64` for RSPMâ€™s fast installation of R package binaries.
:::

To run the docker container, we need to pass in the environment variables for the code to connect to the Connect server. We could pass in the system environment variables, but we will be safer if we just pass in what we need. We do this by creating a project-specific `.Renviron` file. (`fs::file_touch(".Renviron")`) and specifying `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in that file.

Then we run [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command. We set 2 flags, `--env-file` to pass in the environment variables we need, and `--publish` to specify the port.

```bash
docker run --env-file .Renviron --publish 8080:8080 flights
```

## Make predictions from Docker container

Now that the docker container is running we can create an endpoint with `vetiver_endpoint()`, and that endpoint can be used as a way to make predictions.

```{r}
#| eval: false
endpoint <- vetiver_endpoint("http://0.0.0.0:8080/predict")

predict(endpoint, flights_training)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble::tibble(
  .pred = c(-1.7894, -13.3206, -17.2753, -3.6661, 82.8237, 52.177, 10.7185, 8.0357, 58.146, 5.3933, rep(0, 2807)),
)
```
