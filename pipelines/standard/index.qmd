## Loading packages

We are using the tidymodels package to do the modeling and [embed](https://embed.tidymodels.org/) for target encoding.

```{r}
#| label: setup
# install.packages("pak")
# pak::pak("tidymodels", "embed")
library(tidymodels)
library(embed)
```

## Loading Data

We are using the standard `laxflights2022_lite` data set described on the [data preparation](../../data-prep.qmd) page.

```{r}
#| label: loading-data
#| message: false
flights <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data/laxflights2022_lite.csv"))

glimpse(flights)
```

{{< include ../../_include-modeling.qmd >}}

## Results

Once we have the final model, we can do all kinds of analyses. Below we have a truth version prediction plot to showcase how well our model works

```{r}
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Truth against prediction plot. The model has a hard time with overly long 
#|   delays. 
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Scatter chart. `arr_delay` along the x-axis and `.pred` along the y-axis.
#|   A blue line is going diagonally with intercept 0 and slope 1. Most of the
#|   points lie closely towards the line except for a handful of points with 
#|   very right delay values.
xgb_last %>%
  augment() %>%
  ggplot(aes(arr_delay, .pred)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "blue") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  theme_minimal()
```
