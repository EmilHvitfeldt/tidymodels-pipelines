For the smoothest experience, we recommend that you authenticate using environment variables. The two variables you will need are `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

Depending on your S3 setup, you will need to use additional variables to connect. Please see <https://github.com/paws-r/paws/blob/main/docs/credentials.md> and this [pins issue](https://github.com/rstudio/pins-r/issues/608) for help if the following paragraphs doesn't work for you.

::: {.callout-tip}
The function [usethis::edit_r_environ()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html) can be very handy to open `.Renviron` file to specify your environment variables.

You can find both of these keys in the same location. 

1. Open the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
1. Click on your username near the top right and select `Security Credentials`
1. Click on `Users` in the sidebar
1. Click on your username
1. Click on the `Security Credentials` tab
1. Click `Create Access Key`
1. Click `Show User Security Credentials`

Once you have those two, you can add them to your `.Renviron` file in the following format:

```markdown
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Note that you don't want to put quotes around the values.
