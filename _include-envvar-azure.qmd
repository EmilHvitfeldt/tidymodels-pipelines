For the smoothest experience, we recommend that you authenticate using environment variables. The two variables you will need are `AZURE_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_SAS_KEY`.

The function [usethis::edit_r_environ()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html) can be very handy to open `.Renviron` file to specify your environment variables.

First we need to create a Azure container for us to point to. You can find out how to create a [storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&tabs=azure-portal) and how to [create a container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal?view=doc-intel-4.0.0#create-a-container) from the official documentation. Furthermore, [generating a SAS key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/create-sas-tokens?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) should be done as well.

Once you have those two, you can add them to your `.Renviron` file in the following format:

```markdown
AZURE_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AZURE_SAS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The container endpoint will have the following format `https://name-of-storage-account.blob.core.windows.net/name-of-container`.
