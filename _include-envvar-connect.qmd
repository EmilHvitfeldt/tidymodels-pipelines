For the smoothest experience, we recommend that you authenticate using environment variables. The two variables you will need are `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY`.

::: {.callout-tip}
The function [usethis::edit_r_environ()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html) can be very handy to open `.Renviron` file to specify your environment variables.

`CONNECT_SERVER` is the URL of the posit connect page. So if your connect server is accessed through `https://example.com/connect/#/content/` then you can find `CONNECT_SERVER` by removing `connect/` and everything that follows it, leaving you with `https://example.com/`.

`CONNECT_API_KEY` is created through your Connect server. 

1. Click on your name in the upper right.
2. Click `API keys`.
3. Click `New API Key`.
4. Give your API key a name, click `Create Key`.

Once you have those two, you can add them to your `.Renviron` file in the following format:

```markdown
CONNECT_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CONNECT_SERVER=https://example.com/
```

Note that you don't want to put quotes around the values.
